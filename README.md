# bamazon

Running the node bamazonCustomer.js

It makes a call to the mysql database and returns the products available in the store.

The user is then prompted to choose from a list of products which they would like tom purchase.

Then they are prompted to specify a quantity.

and then....BOOM, ERROR.
I've tried and tried fixing this but since it's already 10pm I'm cutting my losses! (Will review that solution).

I think my code is correct after the point of error (Undefined at position 0 for results) and should have calculated the price and updated the database.

All screenshots are in the folder screenshots! The code is included in the repo!
